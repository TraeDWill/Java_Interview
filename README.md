This was a half done file given to me to complete. I was given a list of hours and coffees sold each hour along with a class that had getter methods and held current coffee. 

My answer was in 3 solutions:
- Primitive int array
- Hashmap
- Linkedlist

I also used an in console menu, and each time a choice was made it output 5 different hardcoded unit tests using the "Bifunction" class type to make the methods into parameters.
